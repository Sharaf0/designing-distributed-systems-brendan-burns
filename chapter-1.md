## History of Systems Development
- 1960s: Mainframe computers, batch processing
- 1970s: Time-sharing systems, interactive computing
- 1980s: Personal computers, local area networks
- 1990s: Client-server architecture, web applications
- 2000s: Cloud computing, virtualization
- 2010s: Microservices, containerization

## History of Patterns in Software Development
- 1960s: Donald Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming"
    - Explained algorithms and data structures
    - Provided a general-purpose conceptual framework for different contexts
- Object Oriented Programming
    - Introduced the concept of encapsulation and inheritance
    - Allowed for better organization of code and reuse of components
- Design Patterns
    - Introduced by the "Gang of Four" in 1994
    - Provided a catalog of common solutions to recurring design problems
- Rise of open source software
    - Enabled collaboration and sharing of code
    - Led to the development of popular frameworks and libraries

## Value of Patterns
- Standing on the shoulders of giants
    - Patterns allow developers to leverage the experience of others
- Shared Language
    - Patterns provide a common vocabulary for easy communication
- Reusability
    - Reduce the time and effort required to re-develop new systems
- Improve Quality
    - identify and address common pitfalls, lead to more robust and maintainable systems
- Accelerate Development
    - Patterns can speed up the development process by providing proven solutions
- Security
    - Patterns can help identify and mitigate security risks
